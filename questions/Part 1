1) 
	a. POCO -	Plain old CLR object. In databases case, represents table/view etc as an object.
				Equals overriding is nesessary, because default one will compare object references and will not be able to recognize equality by variables if we want to compare using it
2) 
	a.	Primary Key		- Unique table identifier
	b.	Foreign Key		- Table colimn Unique identifier, that is the key in another table
	c.	1:1				- Relation between tables, where one and only one row from the table relates to one row from another.
		one to many		- Relation between tables, where one row from the table relates to many rows from another, but not vice versa.
		many to many	- Relation between tables, where multiple rows from the table relate to rows from another, and vice versa.
	d.	UNIQUE			- Column that cannot have 
	
3)	Stored procedure provide more secure, more robust and faster way access to database

4)	Connection string - lists parameters needed for connecting to database from the project.
	Stored in XML/Json etc configuration files, preferably in separate project, so the changes can be made without stopping the application

5) 
	•Inner Join -		Combine tables where only matching found for both included
	•Full Outer Join -	Combine tables, include if any of tables have values
	•Left Join -		All values from left table and matching rows from right table.
	•Right Join -		Same as left join, only where all values from right table 

6)	Linq - language integrated query, set of methods built to easily access database object, however it can be used on 

7) Logger writes messages decided by the developer. When accessing database at times will need to write connection issues, failed requests, queries.

9) Partition - separating database table into smaller elements. Provides faster access to response, given the column partitioned.
